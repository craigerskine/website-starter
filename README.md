# website-starter
My sample starter kit for HTML, CSS, JS, .htaccess, etc. This is not a mobile-first approach because it takes more CSS to override mobile first style frameworks than it does to do the simple max-width approach.

Includes utility classes for simplified Bootstrap-like:

* Grid
* Buttons
* Alerts
* Basic Branding
* Forms

TODO: Utility classes for margin and padding spacing.
